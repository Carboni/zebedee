# Zebedee

Zebedee is the CMS used by the ONS website and the internal website publishing system. It is a JSON API and does not 
have a user interface. It comes in 2 flavours:

## zebedee-reader
Zebedee-reader is read-only. It's used by [Babbage][1] (the public facing web frontend of the ONS website) it returns 
the published site content as JSON.

## zebedee-cms
Zebedee-cms is an extension of zebedee-reader. It's used by [Florence][2] and provides API endpoints for managing 
content, users, teams and publishing collecions. Zebedee-CMS is not public facing and requires authentication for the 
majority functionality. Pre-release content is encrypted and requries the appropriate permissions to be able to 
access it.

## Prerequisites 
- git
- Java 8
- Maven
- Docker

Zebedee is an API and does not have a UI. The easiest and quickest way to use it is is via Florence. Clone and set up:
- [Florence][2]
- [Babbage][1]
- [Sixteens][5]
- [dp-compose][6] 

### Getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:ONSdigital/zebedee.git
```

_NOTE_: The following set guide will set up Zebedee in **"CMS"** mode as this is typically how the devlopers will run 
the stack locally. 

### Database... 
Zebedee isn't backed by a database instead it uses a file system to store json files on disk ***. As a result it 
requires a specific directory structure in order to function correctly.

To save yourself some pain you can use the [dp-zebedee-utils/content][3] tool to create the required directory 
structure and populate the CMS with some "default content" - follow the steps in the [README][3] before going any further.

*** _We know this is a terrible idea - but in our defence this is a legacy hangover and we are actively working 
towards deprecating it._
 
Once the script has run successfully copy the generated script from `dp-zebedee-utils/content/generated/run-cms.sh` into
the root dir of your Zebedee project. This bash script compiles and runs Zebedee setting typical dev default 
configuration and uses the content / directory structure generated by dp-zebedee-utils.

You may be required to make the bash script an executable before you can run it. If so run:

````bash
sudo chmod +x run-cms.sh
<Enter you password when prompted>
````  

### Running the publishing stack
In order to use Zebedee you will need to have the following other project running:
- Florence
- Babbage
- Sixteens
- dp-compose

Follow the steps in the README of each project.

#### Running zebedee 
```bash
./run-cms.sh
```

Assuming Zebedee has started without error head to [Florence login][4] and login with the default account:
```
email: florence@magicroundabout.ons.gov.uk
password: Doug4l
```
- If it's the first time logging in you will be prompted to change the password for that user.
- On the home screen create a new collection.
- Click `Create/edit` on the Collection Details screen.

If everything is working correctly you should now see the the ONS website displayed in the right hand pane. 
Congratulations you now have Zebedee working.

If not remain calm and make the internaional distress signal to attract the attention of someone from the dev team to 
assist you.
